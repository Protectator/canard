# Canard
Canard started as a group project at EIA-FR's 2016 Game Design Course.

## Story
After a big storm, a duck lost its ducklings... all of them are now scattered on the river. Go find them!

## Mechanics
You control the duck on a 2D shoot'em up. Dodge the beaver's shots while shooting bread at them!

### Lives

You start the game with 5 lives. Each time you get hit, you lose one life. You are immediately vulnerable again, so stay away from enemies!

### Score

Some actions earn you points, added to your total score.

- Pick up a Duckling: Base 10,000 points (may increase)
- Kill a Beaver: 1,000 points
- Pick up a Pop-Corn: 100 points

Some actions increase all future Duckling's value. These are:

- Pick up a Duckling: + 10,000
- Pick up a Pop-Corn: + 100

Additionally, finishing a level earns you 100,000 points + 20,000 points per remaining life.
